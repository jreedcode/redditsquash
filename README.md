# redditsquash
Source code for generating height, weight and racquet information from the worlds top players. This uses matplotlib in Python to display the graph.

This output shows the weight of Mens (blue) and Womens (pink) on their player card when they joined the tour. Sourced from squashinfo.com.

What I am trying to show from this data is a visualization of a "sweet spot" of player weights at the top level of the game. Something to aim for!
